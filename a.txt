One way to cut back on water consumption is simply to prevent leaks. It is estimated that in some of the biggest cities of the third world, more than half of the water entering the system is lost through leaks in pipes, dripping taps and broken installations. Even in the UK, losses were estimated at 25% in the early 1990s because of the failure to maintain the antiquated water supply infrastructure. In addition, huge quantities of water are consumed because used water from sewage pipes, storm drains and factories is merely flushed away and discharged into rivers or the sea. The modern approach, however, is to see used water as a resource which can be put to good use - - either in irrigation or, after careful treatment, as recycled domestic water. Israel, for example, has spent heavily on used water treatment. Soon treated, recycled water will account for most farm irrigation there. There are other examples in cities such as St. Petersburg, Florida, where all municipal water is recycled back into domestic systems.
